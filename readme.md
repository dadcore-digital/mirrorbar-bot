# Mirror Bar Bot

@mirrorbar on Twitter is a bot that mashes together session titles from "unconferences" like Minnebar in Minneapolis, with dystopian phrases and themes.

This was my first bot. The strucure is kind of a mess. 

On top of the bot is a website that was a version of Minnebar's website I scraped, replaced with Markov text + more dystopian words. 

### Method

The dystopian sources are from various Philip K. Dick short stories. I believe I just parsed for noun phrases of a certain length, and then hand picked hundreds of the most intersting results.

I also either hand scraped or manually copied/pasted session tiles from Minnebar and another unconference, I think in Boston?

I did a simple find/replace of noun phrases from one listing to the other. I might have done some grammar clean up too? Can't remember =\
