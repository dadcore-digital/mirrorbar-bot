Comment on MinneDemo:
Demoing at MinneDemo gave us fantastic exposure.  The format for demoing really helped me refine the core message of what Red Stamp does so it was clear and understood in a short amount of time.  It's focused how we explain and demo our app to others which has led to larger exposure at events like SXSW.

I'm founder of the Minneapolis Biomass Exchange which helps connect buyers and sellers of biomass renewable energy and livestock feed.  
I have 10 years of technology experience, working for several Internet-based companies in Colorado from 2000-2005: a web conferencing company, a library software company, a cell phone recycling company, and a reference management company (sort of like salesforce.com).
Eventually I decided I would be more passionate about the renewable energy industry and here I am.  I came to Minnesota and have learned and worked in biomass consulting roles until July 2009 when I embarked on this startup.
I received my MBA from U of Minnesota in 2007 and bachelors of science degree in computer engineering at the U of Michigan 2000.
At the Minneapolis Biomass Exchange, we deal in wood chips, hays, wheat straw, corn cobs, corn stover, dedicated energy crops (prairie grasses, cottonwoods), etc.

Almost... but not quite local, I grew up in Southeastern Wisconsin and got a degree in Computer Science in 1992.  After a several years living out/about I settled in the San Francisco Bay Area as a systems engineering consultant; working at well-known companies like Cisco Systems, Intel, Philips Electronics and Sun Microsystems.
By 2001 the "DotCom" era was over and I decided to make a career shift.  In 2003 I moved to the Twin Cities to attend graduate school at UMN, finishing in 2006 with a degree in Geographic Information Science.
After several years as GIS Coordinator at a local water resources engineering firm, I began to miss the feeling of innovation and excitement that surrounds the Bay Area.  And so, in 2008 I launched Northstar Geographics (NSG), specializing in applied geographic analysis, web mapping application development, business intelligence services and GIS consulting.

Putting a Neighborhood Online: Creating Sustainable Online Communities at MinneBar 6
Current position is at a small GIS firm called Northstar Geographics. Before that, I worked as a web developer at the University of Minnesota then as an independent web developer (mostly WordPress) for a couple of years.
My main blog (since 2004) is the PF Hyper Blog where I have reported on broadband initiatives (among other topics) in the Twin Cities and elsewhere. I manage (with co-manager Becca Vargo Daggett) the Seward Neighbors Forum, an online discussion group in Seward Neighborhood in Minneapolis. I started the Seward Profile Online News blog in 2009 for Minneapolis's Seward Neighborhood. I'm seeking funding to create a sustainable model that could be ported to any community.
I was on the Minneapolis Digital Inclusion Fund Advisory Committee through 2010 The Committee oversees and funds digital inclusion proposals in Minneapolis.
In 2001, I taught at Minneapolis Community and Technical College and established courses in HTML, CSS, and web scripting for the Electronic and Web Publishing Department. I still serve on the Department's advisory board.
While at the University, I co-founded the CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) Development work group (now the Web Standards Group) which helped in kickstarting widespread use of CSS at University of Minnesota web sites. I'm also on the Minnewebcon organizing committee which stages the University of Minnesota's yearly web conference.
I got a Masters of Public Affairs from the University of Minnesota Humphrey Institute in 2009.
I grew up on northern Minnesota's Iron Range which has a culture more akin to New York City than Minnesota Nice. (Maybe why Robert Zimmerman headed east.) Most of my life has been spent in Minneapolis.
